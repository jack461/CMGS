# The "Concrete Music Gran Studio"

The **GMGS** is a tool aimed at concrete music composers. It is a kind of sampler coupled with an electroacoustic music generator.

This is a project intended to be used with REAPER, since the code
is written in the *JSFX* programming language, that only REAPER supports.

The file ***GameMaster-Doc.pdf*** explains how to use the software, while other *.md* files
describe some aspects of the internals of the system.

The **GMGS** was written by *Jean-Jacques Girardot*, with the invaluable
help of *Jean-Fran√ßois Minjard*.
