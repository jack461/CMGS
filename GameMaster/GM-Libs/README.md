# The Game Master

The **Game Master** is a kind of electroacoustic music generator.

This is a project intended to be used with REAPER, since the code
is written in the *JSFX* programming language, that only REAPER supports.

The **Game Master** was written by *Jean-Jacques Girardot*, with the invaluable
suggestions of *Jean-Fran√ßois Minjard*.
